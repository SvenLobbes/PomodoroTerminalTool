# PomodoroTerminalTool
An little terminal application for the pomodoro working technique

Last thursday i drank 2 beer and i got the spontaneous idea to write a little pomodoro program. So I coded it down in a good hour and got this terminal program. Nothing special, but it does its job. 
It switches between you own defined Work- and Restphases and runs as long as you want to.
