# PomodoroTerminalTool
An little terminal application for the pomodoro working technique

It switches between you own defined Work- and Restphases and runs as long as you want to.
Just run it in the background and you always get a notification, if there is a switch. 

I wrote it so that you can always see the desktop notification regardless of the operating system, accordingly it works on Linux, macOS and Windows
